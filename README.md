## 🚀 About Me
I'm a physicist-turned-systems engineer focused on **distributed systems**, **databases**, **blockchain infrastructure**, and **machine intelligence**. I enjoy building systems from first principles and solving hard, high-impact problems.

## 🧠 What Drives Me
- Solve **important problems** that move humanity forward.
- Build production-grade systems from scratch (e.g. key-value stores, validators, MEV tooling).
- Explore intersections of **distributed systems** and **algorithmic game theory**.

## 🛠️ Current Work & Projects
- **Custom Transaction Injector** for Jito Bundles (Solana) — validator/MEV tooling.
- **Decentralized CLOB** (Central Limit Order Book) on Aptos.
- Experiments in distributed databases, transaction sequencing, and validator-level MEV.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Rust · Python · TypeScript · SQL · OCaml
- **Blockchains & Tools:** Solana · Aptos · Move · Anchor · web3.js · spl-token
- **Systems:** Distributed DBs · Transaction sequencing · MEV pipelines
- **ML / AI:** NLP · Statistical methods · Classical ML

## 🌱 Learning Right Now
- Advanced database internals and storage engines
- Validator infrastructure and on-chain sequencing

## 🎯 5-Year Vision
Work at the cutting edge of distributed consensus, AI, and blockchain infrastructure — collaborating with top researchers and builders to create systems that expand human capability.

## 💬 Background & Personal Notes
I transitioned from data science after realizing I wanted to build foundational systems rather than produce generic AI products. A fraud incident in April 2024 reshaped my perspective on security, trust, and resilience — and motivated me to focus on meaningful technical problems and personal growth.
